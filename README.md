🚀 Exciting Milestone: Completed Image Segmentation Project using U-Net!

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a high-precision implementation of the U-Net architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation. The model is specifically optimized to automate the detection of cells and tissues in microscopic imagery, reducing manual annotation time for researchers.

🧠 Architecture Deep Dive
## The U-Net model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) characterized by its symmetric "U" shape:

## Contracting Path (Encoder): Captures context through downsampling and feature extraction.

## Expansive Path (Decoder): Enables precise localization through upsampling.

## Skip Connections: Links the encoder and decoder to preserve spatial information and fine-grained details that are often lost during pooling.
