## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository features a high-precision implementation of the **U-Net architecture** tailored for biomedical image segmentation. The primary goal is to automate the detection of cells and tissues in microscopic imagery, significantly reducing the manual annotation bottleneck for researchers and medical professionals.

## 🧠 Architecture Deep Dive
The U-Net model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) characterized by its symmetric "U" shape, designed to work with fewer training images while yielding high-precision masks.

* **Contracting Path (Encoder):** Extracts deep features and captures global context through successive convolutions and max-pooling layers.
* **Expansive Path (Decoder):** Recovers spatial resolution through upsampling (transposed convolutions), enabling precise pixel-level localization.
* **Skip Connections:** The "secret sauce" that concatenates high-resolution features from the encoder directly to the decoder, preserving fine-grained details lost during downsampling.

### Mathematical Representation
The final feature map integration can be represented as:
$$O = \sigma(W \cdot [X_{up} ; X_{skip}] + b)$$
*Where $[X_{up} ; X_{skip}]$ denotes the concatenation of upsampled and encoder features.*
